C
C++
Ruby - 1995

.NET - 1999
Node.js - 2009

Golang - 2010
    Easy to use
    Compatible 
    Easy to learn
    Execution time
    Memory Efficient
    More features when compared to other languages
    Platform independent
    third party modules


    Simplicity
        25 keywords
            No classes, while, exceptions, try catch

    More close to the hardware
        Better performance
    
    Fast compiler

    Built for concurrency
        Language features for concurrency
            go, range, select, data type - chan
        Builtin Scheduler in the runtime
        Does not have 'exceptions, throw, try catch'

    Ways of solving concurrency problems
        Multithreading
            Resource heavy feature
                4 MB for each thread
            Adds other complexities
                Data has to be threadsafe
                Handle race conditions
                Avoid dead locks
                
        Single thread
            Resource Efficient
            Difficult to accommodate long running cpu intensive tasks

        Goroutines
            Thread like infrastructure
            Multiple goroutines are executed in a single thread
            Scheduler is builtin in the runtime
            Resource Efficient
                2 KB for each goroutine

    
Data types in Go
    bool
    string

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real float32 imaginary float32)
    complex128 (real float64 imaginary float64)
    
    byte alias for uint8
    rune alias for int32

Higher Order Functions
    Assign functions to variables
    Pass a function as an argument to another function
    Return a function as a return value from another function
        (to create a closure)
    Variadic functions (demo pending)

Collections Types
    Array
        Fixed Size
    Slice
        Varyiing size
        uses an array internally
        
    Map

    collection supporting construct
        range
